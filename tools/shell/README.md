## TuxDB-Shell

TuxDB-Shell has been developed to run the processes located in TuxDB via command line interface.

## Run 

If you want to run the shell, you should enter the following command in the command line interface after tuxdb is running.

    $ python3 main.py

**Note:** If tuxdb is running in different connection point out of the default (host="127.0.0.1", port=6060), you should go to **"/settings.json"** path and you replace the connection point parameters (host, port) with the correct one.
