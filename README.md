# TuxDB

TuxDB is a DBMS that is developed with No-SQL logic. I inspired from the MongoDB-Shell when i design the TuxDB-Shell. That's why the syntax of the TuxDB-Shell is similar the syntax of the MongoDB-Shell. If you interested in the design of the TuxDB-Core structure, you can review the design of TuxDB-Core from the [core-design-docs]()

# Build

Currently, TuxDB is under testing. Therefore, there is no auto build component to do the build for now. If you want to build manual the TuxDB, you can see the build instructions from the [build-doc]()
