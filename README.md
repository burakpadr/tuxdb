# TuxDB

TuxDB is a DBMS that is developed with No-SQL logic. I inspired from the MongoDB-Shell when i design the TuxDB-Shell. That's why the syntax of the TuxDB-Shell is similar the syntax of the MongoDB-Shell. If you interested in the design of the TuxDB-Core structure, you can review the design of TuxDB-Core from the [core-design-docs]()
